# Broadcast API Documentation

The Broadcast API allows staff members with managerial permissions to send messages to multiple users across various communication channels (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, and Platform Notifications).

## Behavioral Specifications

### 1. Asynchronous Execution
When a broadcast is created, the API returns immediately with a `201 Created` status. The actual delivery happens in the background via Celery. The broadcast status will transition from `pending` -> `in_progress` -> `sent` (or `partial` / `failed`).

### 2. Targeting Logic
- The system identifies all active users matching the specified roles.
- If multiple roles are selected, the broadcast is sent to the union of all matching users.
<!-- - For `platform` notifications, a `Notification` record is created for each recipient, and a real-time message is pushed via WebSockets (Django Channels). -->
<!--
### 3. Medium-Specific Logic
- **Email**: Uses `send_mass_mail` for efficient delivery.
- **SMS**: Sends through the configured SMS provider (e.g., Kudi).
- **WhatsApp**: (Current Implementation Note) WhatsApp delivery might require pre-approved templates depending on the provider configuration.
- **Platform**: Creates internal notifications visible in the candidate/staff dashboards. -->

<!-- ### 4. Logging and Retries
- Every attempt to send a broadcast to a specific role-medium combination is logged in `BroadcastLog`.
- If an entire broadcast fails due to a retryable error (like a database connection issue), the Celery task will retry up to 3 times with a 60-second delay. -->

### 5. Caching
- Broadcast details are cached for 1 hour to reduce database load.
- The cache for a specific broadcast is automatically invalidated once the background sending task completes.
