## Frontend Client Logic & Visibility

This section describes the internal logic used to determine which exams are visible to candidates and how the dashboard behaves in edge cases.

### 1. Visibility Toggle (`StageExam.is_active`)
Visibility on the candidate dashboard is primarily controlled by the `is_active` flag on the `StageExam` (competition slot).
- **Draft State:** When an exam is created but not yet scheduled, `StageExam.is_active` is `false`. It will not appear on the dashboard.
- **Published/Scheduled State:** When an admin sets a `scheduled_date` on an exam, the system automatically flips the linked `StageExam.is_active` to `true`.
- **Deactivation:** If an exam is marked `is_active = false` on the `Exam` model, the competition slot visibility is also revoked.
- **Retraction:** When an exam is retracted, it reverts to `DRAFT` status and `StageExam.is_active` is automatically set to `false`, immediately hiding it from candidates.

### 2. Graceful Visibility (Leniency)
To prevent issues where an exam is live but the visibility flag was manually unset or missed, the **Candidate Dashboard** applies a leniency rule:
- If an exam's status is `ONGOING` (current time is within the scheduled window), it will be visible to eligible candidates **even if** `StageExam.is_active` is `false`.

### 3. Candidate Enrollment Fallback
The dashboard requires a `Enrollment` record to determine a candidate's "Current Stage."
- **Enrolled Candidates:** The dashboard uses `enrollment.current_stage`.
- **Unenrolled Candidates:** If a candidate has no enrollment record for the active competition, the dashboard falls back to using the candidate's `role` (e.g., `screening`, `league`) to infer their current stage. This ensures that new registrants see the screening exam immediately even if the background enrollment task hasn't completed.

### 4. Awaiting Results
Once an exam is `CONCLUDED` and the candidate has participated, the exam remains visible in the "Active Exam" section with a status of `awaiting_results` until the official **RankingSnapshot** are published by an admin.
