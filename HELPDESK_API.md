# Helpdesk API Documentation

The Helpdesk system facilitates authenticated communication between candidates and staff members. This document outlines the available endpoints, status transition logic, and automated features.

## Data Models

### HelpdeskThread
- **status**: `open`, `in_progress`, `closed`, `snoozed` (Default: `open`)
- **priority**: `low`, `medium`, `high` (Default: `medium`)
- **snoozed_until**: DateTime when the thread should automatically re-open (if status is `snoozed`).

### ThreadMessage
- **sender_type**: `candidate`, `staff`, `system`
- **text**: Message content.

---

## Endpoints

### 1. Get/Create Candidate Thread
**GET** `/v1/comms/helpdesk/thread/`
*Permission: Authenticated User (Candidate)*

- **Behavior**: Retrieves the unique thread for the authenticated candidate. If no thread exists, it creates one and sends a system welcome message.
- **Side Effect**: Marks all staff messages in the thread as read. If the thread was `open`, it transitions to `in_progress`.

### 2. Send Message
**POST** `/v1/comms/helpdesk/thread/{thread_id}/message/`
*Permission: Authenticated User (Owner or Moderator+)*

- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "text": "Hello, I need help with my exam."
  }
  ```
- **Status Transitions**:
    - **Candidate Message**:
        - If `snoozed` and `snoozed_until` is in the future: Status remains `snoozed`.
        - Otherwise: Status transitions to `open`.
    - **Staff/System Message**: Status transitions to `in_progress`.
- **Side Effect**: Broadcasts the message via WebSocket to `helpdesk_thread_{thread_id}`. Triggers escalation checks if sent by a candidate during an ongoing exam.

### 3. List Threads (Staff)
**GET** `/v1/comms/staff/helpdesk/threads/`
*Permission: Active Moderator+*

- **Behavior**: Lists all threads containing at least one candidate message, ordered by unread count and activity.
- **Includes**: Real-time helpdesk stats (total open, unread, etc.).

### 4. Thread Detail (Staff)
**GET** `/v1/comms/staff/helpdesk/threads/{id}/`
*Permission: Active Moderator+*

- **Side Effect**: Marks all candidate messages in the thread as read. Auto-reverts `snoozed` status to `closed` if `snoozed_until` has passed.

### 5. Thread Action (Staff)
**PATCH** `/v1/comms/staff/helpdesk/threads/{id}/action`
*Permission: Active Admin+*

- **Request Body (Close)**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "closed"
  }
  ```
- **Request Body (Snooze)**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "snoozed",
    "snoozed_until": "2026-03-14T10:00:00Z"
  }
  ```
- **Validation**: `snoozed_until` is mandatory when status is `snoozed`.

## Automated Features

### 1. Helpdesk Escalation
If a candidate sends a message during an ongoing exam and no staff member replies within **2 minutes**, the system:
1.  Sends a Slack alert to the support channel.
2.  Notifies Admins and Managers via Email, Platform, and SMS.

### 2. Snooze Cleanup
A periodic task runs every **5 minutes** to identify threads in `snoozed` status where `snoozed_until` has passed. These threads are automatically transitioned to `closed`.

### 3. Real-time Updates
All thread activity (messages, status updates) is broadcasted via Django Channels to both the candidate and staff dashboards for real-time UI updates.
